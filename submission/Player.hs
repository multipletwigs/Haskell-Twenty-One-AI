-- *THINGS TO NOTE* 
-- 1. rank refers to the ranking of the player in the last round, the higher the rank the more points you have in [PlayerPoints].
-- 2. winStreak increases when there is a positive change in point ranking, based off on last round and a current round.  
-- 3. runCount refers to the runningCount kept track throughout the game.
-- 4. currCount tracks the count of ONE particular turn for a player. 
-- 5. cardsSeen refers to the true number of cards seen within the shoe, kept track using `mod` 156. 
-- 6. currCardsS refers to the number of cards seen for ONE particular turn for a player.

-- !Note: Math behind card counting
-- In order to obtain the running count of a card game, we need to recognize the fact that the playing round has player information complement to the player information to the bidding round. 
-- VERY PLAYING ROUND
-- EXAMPLE FOR PLAYER 1, in this example, player 1 is the fourth player: 
-- Playing Round -> ["7" [],"9" [],"4" [],"2" [],"0" [],"8" [],"1" [],"6" [DJ,H5,DK],"3" [DT,DA,C7,C2],"5" [C8,SJ,S6,S3]]
-- Memory -> "10|B|0|0|0|0|0|0", here count and cards seen is still 0 from very first bidding round
-- Metrics: 
-- currCount = -1, in this playing round, the round count is -1 
-- currCardS = 11, in this playing round there are 11 cards, excluding dealer hand and excluding player hand
-- Here we exclude the dealer hand and player hand because information is NOT the latest for these two at any given round. 
-- *PLAYER 1 STANDS, THE ROUND ENDS 

-- Bidding round 
-- ["6" [],"3" [],"5" [],"dealer" [HA,D9],"7" [HJ,S2,D6,H8],"9" [D8,HT],"4" [CQ,C9,C6],"2" [DK,S3,DQ],"0" [H8,HJ,S2],"8" [H7,HQ],"1" [DA,CT]]
-- Memory -> Just "10|S|0|0|0|-1|0|11", we can see that the currCount and currCardS is bought from last round to bidding round. 
-- In every bidding round, we have the complete information of the dealer, and our own cards + complete hands of player after us 
-- Metrics: 
-- cardsSeen = cards seen from last round (11) + cards seen in this round (21) = 32 
-- runningCount = currCount from last round (-1) + count from this round (-5) = -6 

-- In the bidding round, we can determine the trueCount of the running count by determining how many decks we have left. 
-- First we need to find out how many decks we have left based on the number of cards we have seen 
-- We can do this by having numDecks (3) - (cardsSeen / 52), since one deck has 52 cards, and maximum number of cards we can see is 52 * 3 = 156 cards at any given round. 

-- Once we have the number of decks left, we can then divide the runningCount with the number of decks left, by performing runningCount / number of decks left. 

-- The reason why I have created a safeDiv function is because there can be a case where cardsSeen is exactly 156, although rare, but it can happen. If the exact cardsSeen is 156, this means that the number of decks left calculated will be 0. And hence when dividing by the runningCount a division by 0 error can happen. So if there exist a case where there are EXACTLY 0 decks left, we will treat it as having one deck left.

-- If the cardsSeen amount exceed by 156, which is possible due to the way it is counted, then we know the whole shoe of cards is finished, and we reset the runningCount back to 0.
