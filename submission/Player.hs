-- *THINGS TO NOTE* 
-- 1. count refers to the true count kept track throughout the game, and 
-- 2. currCount tracks the count of ONE particular turn for a player. 
-- 3. rank refers to the ranking of the player in the last round, the higher the rank the more points you have in [PlayerPoints].
-- 4. winStreak increases when there is a positive change in point ranking, based off on last round and a current round.  
-- 5. cardsSeen refers to the true number of cards seen within the 3 decks, kept track using `mod` 156. 
-- 6. currCardsS refers to the number of cards seen for ONE particular turn for a player.
